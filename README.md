# Audience Rating Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict the audience_rating based on various features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Scikit-Learn.

## Features:

• **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming features (numerical and categorical).

• **Model Training:** Using a pipeline for training models like Random Forest.

• **Model Evaluation:** Assessing accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

You can directly run the notebook in Google Colab.

## Evaluation

• **Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R2 Score.

• **Cross-validation:** Used to assess generalization.

Feel free to fork and submit pull requests.

This version includes the Google Colab link, making it easier for users to run the project directly in Colab.
